Koichi Harukure &amp;ldquo;Mortal Game&amp;rdquo;
The Search for Interstellar Life project has discovered an organic cellular automaton. The rules are deterministic, and calculations show that all &amp;ldquo;cells&amp;rdquo; will disappear in the near future. Cellular automata are life-like if they are self-replicators that spontaneously reproduce from their environment, whereas a phenomenon whose behavior can be computed deterministically cannot be treated as life. Should we leave the automaton untouched and let it &amp;ldquo;go extinct&amp;rdquo; in order not to disturb its natural environment, or should we &amp;ldquo;breed&amp;rdquo; it and modify the rules to foster long-period patterns?</description></item></channel></rss>
